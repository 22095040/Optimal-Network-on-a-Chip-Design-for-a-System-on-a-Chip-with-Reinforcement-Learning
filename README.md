## README - Optimal Network-on-a-Chip Design for a System-on-a-Chip with Reinforcement Learning

### Overview
This project aims to design an optimal Network-on-a-Chip (NoC) for a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architecture, consisting of a CPU and I/O peripherals accessing a shared System memory through a weighted arbiter. The NoC is optimized for specific performance metrics like latency, bandwidth, buffer occupancy, and throttling. We use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to adjust key NoC parameters to achieve optimal results.

### Requirements
To run this code and set up the necessary environment, you'll need the following:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `pandas`
- Access to the simulator environment modeling the SoC and NoC

### Instructions
1. Clone the GitHub repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the main script to initiate the simulator and set up the NoC optimization process:
   ```bash
   python optimize_noc.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the initial parameters for the NoC, such as buffer sizes, arbiter weights, and throttling rates.
5. Observe the results as the RL agent adjusts the NoC parameters to achieve optimal performance.
6. After execution, the script will provide a summary of the optimal configuration and a report on latency, bandwidth, buffer occupancy, and throttling.

### Key Features
- Uses Reinforcement Learning to optimize NoC parameters for desired performance.
- Ensures efficient design in terms of area and power consumption.
- Provides a detailed report on performance metrics like latency, bandwidth, buffer occupancy, and throttling rates.

### Project Structure
- `optimize_noc.py`: Main script to run the simulation and execute the RL-based NoC optimization.
- `noc_simulator.py`: Simulator setup for the System-on-a-Chip and Network-on-a-Chip modeling.
- `README.md`: This README file with setup instructions and project details.

### Pseudocode for Measuring Average Latency and Bandwidth

```pseudocode
# Function to calculate average latency from simulator output
function calculate_avg_latency(monitor_output):
    read_latencies = []
    # Iterate through the monitor output to find Read and Data transactions
    for i in range(len(monitor_output) - 1):
        if monitor_output[i].TxnType == "Rd" and monitor_output[i + 1].TxnType == "Data":
            read_latencies.append(monitor_output[i + 1].Timestamp - monitor_output[i].Timestamp)
    # Return average read latency
    return sum(read_latencies) / len(read_latencies)

# Function to calculate average bandwidth from simulator output
function calculate_avg_bandwidth(monitor_output):
    total_bytes = 0
    # Iterate through the monitor output to calculate total bytes transferred
    for entry in monitor_output:
        if entry.Data != None:
            total_bytes += len(entry.Data)
    # Calculate bandwidth as bytes per second (assuming 1 cycle = 1 second for simplicity)
    total_cycles = monitor_output[-1].Timestamp - monitor_output[0].Timestamp
    return total_bytes / total_cycles

# Example monitor output
monitor_output = [
    {"Timestamp": 0, "TxnType": "Rd", "Data": None},
    {"Timestamp": 2, "TxnType": "Wr", "Data": "'hxxxxxxxx"},
    {"Timestamp": 10, "TxnType": "Data", "Data": "'hzzzzzzzz"},
    {"Timestamp": 15, "TxnType": "Wr", "Data": "'haaaa"},
    {"Timestamp": 18, "TxnType": "Data", "Data": "'hyyyyy"}
]

# Calculate average latency
avg_latency = calculate_avg_latency(monitor_output)

# Calculate average bandwidth
avg_bandwidth = calculate_avg_bandwidth(monitor_output)

print("Average Latency:", avg_latency)
print("Average Bandwidth:", avg_bandwidth)
```
